#Rest ful API with Node JS

What is Rest ?

Representational State Transfer
(Used to transfer data around)

Why RestAPI, why not traditional app ?

USeful  for scenarios where multiple clients are interested to exchange data in a particular format.
Useful for scenarios where you want to communicate to thirdparty data and want the data to be exchanged.

So RestAPI stands as a backend wich supports all the CRUD operations on an exposed Stateless endpoint.

CRUD (Create , Read , Update , Delete )
